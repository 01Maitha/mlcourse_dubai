[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) is an open Machine Learning course by [OpenDataScience](https://ods.ai/en/). The course is designed to perfectly balance theory and practice. You can take part in several Kaggle Inclass competitions held during the course. From spring 2017 to fall 2019, 6 sessions of mlcourse.ai took place - 26k participants applied, 10k converted to passing the first assignment, about 1500 participants finished the course. Currently, the course is in self-paced mode. A thorough roadmap guiding you through the self-paced mlcourse.ai will be published in February, 2020.
