[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) is an open Machine Learning course by [OpenDataScience](https://ods.ai/en/). The course is designed to perfectly balance theory and practice. You can take part in several Kaggle Inclass competitions held during the course. From spring 2017 to fall 2019, 6 sessions of mlcourse.ai took place - 26k participants applied, 10k converted to passing the first assignment, about 1500 participants finished the course. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to get a dive into the Data Science world.


The course starts on 19th of February. The event will be hold by Hult International Business School.
All lectures will be covered by tutors with the practical experience from Reactor, FICO, Deloitte, VISA, American University of Sharjah.
